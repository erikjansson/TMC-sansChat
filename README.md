# TMC Sans Chat

So, The Magic Café is ugly. To make things worse, they also overlay part of their site with a chat which is annoying and in the way. This tiny Chrome extension simply hides the chat.

## Installation

Download and install the TMC-sansChat.crx file up there. Easiest way is to click it, and then click "View Raw".  
It will then download and ask you to install it.

You're welcome.
